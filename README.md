# website
My old (md3 themed) portfolio website!

I generally don't think you need help with it, I'm sure you can easily figure out what you should do.

Source code won't be available until I move, which is tomorrow (16-Sep-25)-(approx 20-Sep-25). For now, visit www.virex.lol/ if youre intrested at looking at my site.
